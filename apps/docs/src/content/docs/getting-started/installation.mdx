import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Install useFlow using your preferred package manager.

## Package managers

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @useflow/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @useflow/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @useflow/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @useflow/react
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What gets installed

<Aside type="tip" title="What You Get">
  When you install `@useflow/react`, you automatically get:

  - **@useflow/react** - React hooks and components
  - **@useflow/core** - Framework-agnostic flow logic (included as dependency)
  - **Zero external dependencies** - Just React, no bloat
  - **TypeScript types included** - Full type safety out of the box
</Aside>

## Requirements

useFlow works with modern React versions:

- **React** `^18.0.0` or `^19.0.0`
- **React DOM** `^18.0.0` or `^19.0.0` (for web applications)
- **TypeScript** `^5.0.0` (optional, but recommended)

## TypeScript support

useFlow is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No additional `@types` packages are needed.
